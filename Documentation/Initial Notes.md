# Garden Tracker Initial Notes

## What do we want?

- Track each of our pots and what's growing in them
- List of all of our pots
- So, add / remove pots at runtime
- Add / Remove plants at runtime
- Have a task list of what needs done for each of our growing plants

  - Stored list of tasks associated with plants
  - Needs to take time of year into consideration

- 2D layout of the garden
  - Nice to have, worry about this later

## Tech Stack

Needs to be accessible on mobile so we can use it in the garden.
Must have records of plants and tasks associated with them.
Must maintain records of our pots that can be updated at runtime.

The main contenders for android development now seem to be Dart and Kotlin. Dart appears to be a better choice if we care about cross platform development... which for this, we don't.

Time to learn Kotlin!
